# SpaceDyS technical interview day

This is my solution to SpaceDyS test. The requirements are
1. create a script (python, fortran, perl, ...) that reags the header of a FITS picture and give back the RA, DEC (both in decimal degrees) and Integration time.
2. Install SExtractor and use it on a FITS picture to extract data. The result should give a list of source point positions and magnitude (light flux)
3. Read the FITS image at extract the median from the matrix of the pixels
